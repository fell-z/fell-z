## Hi! 👋🥸🤏

First starting with me, I'm a developer who likes most, if not all, technologies 😅, but I like to focus mainly in Web Development.
I also try in my spare time, to create some games in Godot, and... well, I play guitar and the violin sometimes.

- 📖 I'm currently learning *WebDev* using the course [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)
